# This is our first Post!

Cindy is a passionate buyer and a heavy crypto asset holder. Everytime when she wants to go shopping, she wonders why she can't directly pay with her crypto currencies. Currently she could only sell her crypto assets in centralised exchange platform or local exchange platform where funny frauds appear several times. Cindy hates to go through these hassle to utilize cryptos and wonder when she will be able to directly use her cryptos to pay for the bill conveniently and securely.

Dan is local dairy farmer and his farm produces high quality milk and dairy products in small scale. He can't easily sell the production at a reasonable price directly to end consumers but only sell to wholesalers in a much cheaper price. Dan is not satisfied with his situation and wants to promote his products directly to local consumers.

From today, people like Cindy and Dan will not be bothered by these inconvenience and problems any more because of **Virto Network**. Virto Network creates a new brilliant solution - **Local Incentives Protocol** by enabling a **De-Commerce** infrastructure with block chain technology:

- For merchants, they could easily create their own **marketplaces** to directly face and serve consumers and avoid cost of intermediaries. All needed is for builders to simply connect their own system to high level Web2-like APIs offered by Virto 

- For users, they could easily use their crpytos to buy any products or services offered by the marketplace, including fiat money. It means, users could not only easily utilise cryptos in exchange for goods, but also this easy swap to fiat provides a bridge between the metaverse and real society. **Swap.Cash**, one of the core team's reference application will be launched soon this year, before that the first testing will be open to users in Karura in the H1 2022.

Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba these global E-commerce platforms have been steadily increasing in the past decades, which offers opportunities to integrate millions of marketplaces. Meanwhile more and more critics have also arose, especially concentrating on its anti-competitive or monopolistic behaviors, which result in price control, price discrimination and employee management. These however would never be possible in a decentralised system backed up by block chain technology, in contrary, all these missing valuable virtues, **fairness, transparency, efficiency** will be better respected and valued in **De-commerce** system  as it's rooted in the initial design.

In addition, **Local Incentives Protocol** also promotes **DAO: Decentralised Autonomous Organisation** by reserving part of the transaction fees into local tax, which is only at the disposal of local communities formed and governed by the users. This will also help the system fight against resource monopoly within the system and support local economy transformed into **DAO**.
